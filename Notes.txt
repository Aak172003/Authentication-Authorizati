Dufference b/w     Hashing 	v/s Encryption

Hashing :

1. It is more secure in comparison to encryption.
2. The output of a hashing algorithm is a fixed-size hash value	
3. The hashed information is generally of small and fixed length. It does not grow with the increase in the information length of information.	
4. Hashing does not require a secret key or algorithm to produce a hash value	

5. ( Imp )  -> The hash code or key can not be reversed to the original information by any means. It can only be mapped and the hash code is checked if the hash code is the same the information is the same otherwise not. The original information can not be retrieved.

Encryption & Decryption :

1. It is less secure in comparison to hashing.
2. the output of an encryption algorithm is ciphertext of the same size or larger than the original data
3. The encrypted information is not of fixed length. It grows with the increase in length of information.
4. encryption requires a secret key or algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data.
5. The original information can be easily retrieved if we know the encryption key and algorithm used for encryption.
